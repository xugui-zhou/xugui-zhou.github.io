            <h3>EE/CSC 7700: ML for Security in Cyber-Physical Systems - Fall 2024</h3>
            
            <p>Instructor: Xugui Zhou, xuguizhou@lsu.edu, Office: ERAD Building 333 </br>
                Office Hours: Friday 3-4 pm or by appointment 
            </p>

            <p> Time: M/W/F 10:30-11:20 am <br>
                Location: Patrick F. Taylor Hall 1218

            <p> This course provides a general exploration of the intersection between machine learning
                (ML) techniques and security principles within the context of cyber-physical systems (CPS).
                Cyber-physical systems integrate computational and physical components to monitor and
                control various processes, including industrial systems, autonomous vehicles, and medical
                devices. As these systems become increasingly interconnected and autonomous, ensuring their
                security and safety against cyber threats becomes paramount. 
            </p>

            <p> The course begins with an overview of fundamental concepts in machine learning and
                cybersecurity, laying the groundwork for understanding their application in CPS environments.
                Students will then delve into advanced ML algorithms and techniques tailored to address
                security challenges in CPS, such as anomaly detection, threat prediction, and hazard mitigation. 
            </p>    
            <p> Throughout the course, students will engage in hands-on exercises, simulations, and projects to
                reinforce theoretical concepts and develop practical skills in ML-based security for cyber-
                physical systems. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and
                tools necessary to design, implement, and evaluate ML-driven security solutions tailored to the
                unique challenges of CPS environments.
            </p>
