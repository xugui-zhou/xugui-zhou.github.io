  <h2>Summary of the Paper</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
    <p>
      The paper discusses the importance of understanding the reasons behind machine learning model predictions. This
      understanding is crucial for building trust in the model, especially when relying on its predictions for
      decision-making. The authors propose LIME, a technique that explains model predictions by learning a simpler,
      interpretable model locally around the prediction.
      They also introduce a method to select representative individual predictions and their explanations to provide a
      concise and informative overview of the model's behavior.
      The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through various experiments, including simulated and
      human-subject studies, in scenarios that require trust in machine learning models. These scenarios include
      deciding on the reliability of a prediction, selecting between different models, improving untrustworthy models,
      and identifying potential biases or limitations in the model.

  <h2 class="unnumbered" id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
  <p><strong>Discussion 1: How can we replace the interpretable representation so that it is more flexible? </strong></p>
  <p>
  Group 6 suggested use of LLMs to intepret the pixels. LLMs traditionally interpret features using words, so by having words label
  the pixel groups (such as "guitar" for the pixels composing the neck of guitar), we can establish the same benefits of interpratability
  while also becoming more easily understandable for humans.
  
  The presenter and teammate (Group 8) mentioned it was a good idea but some tradeoffs include the introduction of reliance on LLMs.
  In addition, the LLM itself is generally an ambiguous black box approach which is part of the challenge this paper aims to address.
  
  Group 6 member again remarked that the benefit of human intepretability might just be enough to counter the lack of accuracy introduced.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Discussion 2: What are some potential complexity measures or ways to better approximate interpretability?</strong></p>
  <p>N/A</p>
  <p><strong>Discussion 3: What are other classes of models that could be used for explanation?</strong></p>
  <p>
  Group 5 suggested using a model-specific approach instead of the utilized model-agnostic black box approach.
  Group 6 and the presenter remarked how that could be sufficient but is important to note the dependability on the specific inputs and
  outputs cause the results to be a certani way, moreso than the model itself.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Discussion 4: Are there alternative perturbation strategies that may perform better?</strong></p>
  <p>N/A</p>


  <h2 class="unnumbered" id="questions">Questions</h2>
  <p><strong>Q1: Dr. Zhou asked for a brief and simple explanation of how LIME works?</strong></p>
  <p>The presenter mentions that the method starts with local fidelity, meaning it looks at one instance at a time. They
    have a single image which is sampled around it, obtaining other similar and smaller images related to the original
    one. The model then uses the original input image and the sampled images for training; it computes a classification
    prediction of the image and analyzes what the outcome is. Finally, it fits a simple linear regression network to
    understand the data. In summary, it attempts to use simpler versions of the input data to classify it.</p>
  <p><strong>Q2: Dr. Zhou asked how to understand the interpretability of the model.</strong></p>
  <p>Depends on how we interpret representation, which is one of the limitations of the paper. Super pixels are just
    patches of the image that the model chooses to use. This is useful for some applications, but not for others.</p>
  <p><strong>Q3: Group 5 asked if the explainability is based on the feature or the model. How does the model obtain the
      features.</strong></p>
  <p>For text, this happens before embedding it during hot vectoring. For images, they come from a superpixel algorithm.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Q4: Group 5 asked how interpretability and explainability are different.</strong></p>
  <p>They are similar, but present small differences. Intepretability has more to do with how good to interpret the
    representation, making it easier to understand. Explainability is how easy to explain.</p>
  <p><strong>Q5: Group 6 asked how noise is being injected into the system</strong></p>
  <p>The presenter mentions that the authors are using a mask on top of the image. Given some inputs, it randomly picks
    some patches and then perturbs the image. Sampling is not done with noise, it is simply choosing which patches to
    account for. It is explained also as blacking out part of the input image. Many methods are available for this
    matter.</p>
