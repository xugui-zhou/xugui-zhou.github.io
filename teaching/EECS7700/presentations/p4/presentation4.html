  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This presentation explores the forensic analysis of deep learning models using a novel technique called AiP (AI
    Psychiatry). AiP is designed to recover machine learning models from memory images, which is critical for
    investigating models that have been compromised or attacked. This process is especially important for understanding
    models in production environments. AiP supports popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch and has
    demonstrated 100% accuracy in recovering models from memory for further analysis.</p>

  <h2>ML Model</h2>

  <p>
    This slide presents different types of attacks on machine learning models commonly used in autonomous vehicles.
    Attacks using Pattern, Pixel, Patch, and Watermark illustrate how traffic signs are manipulated during
    training for self-driving cars. These adversarial attacks aim to subtly alter the input data to trick the model into
    making incorrect predictions, which could lead to safety-critical failures in real-world applications.
  </p></div>

  <h2>ML Model Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <a href="Slide3.png"><img src="Slide3.png" alt="Image-2" class="image-frame"></a>
  <p>Machine learning models are often targeted through various attacks, including data poisoning, adversarial examples,
    and backdoor attacks. In data poisoning, attackers introduce malicious data during training, which compromises the
    integrity of the model. Similarly, backdoor attacks involve embedding hidden triggers that can later cause the model
    to make incorrect predictions. AiP helps identify these vulnerabilities by allowing forensic analysts to inspect and
    understand how these malicious inputs influence the model’s predictions. By recovering models directly from memory,
    AiP bypasses the need for access to original training data or binaries.</p></div>

  <h2>Understanding Vulnerabilities: From Benign to Compromised Machine Learning Models</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <a href="Slide4.png"><img src="Slide4.png" alt="Image-3" class="image-frame"></a>
  <p>The slide illustrates three configurations of a machine learning model, showcasing the progression from a benign
    classifier to potentially compromised versions through the integration of malicious elements. The first diagram
    displays
    a typical benign classifier processing an input to produce an output. The second introduces a merging layer,
    depicted in
    orange, symbolizing how a backdoor or malicious modification could be seamlessly integrated into the standard model
    structure, subtly altering its output. The third diagram shows a backdoor classifier with direct modifications to
    the
    architecture, highlighted in red, indicating the nodes where the backdoor mechanism is incorporated, also affecting
    the
    model’s output. This visual representation emphasizes the susceptibility of machine learning models to subtle and
    harmful modifications that can significantly alter their behavior, underscoring the critical need for robust
    security
    measures in their deployment.</p></div>

  <h2>Cross-Regional Risks: Propagation of Backdoors in Machine Learning Models</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <a href="Slide5.png"><img src="Slide5.png" alt="Image-4" class="image-frame"></a>
  <p>This slide demonstrates the impact of backdoored training data on machine learning models, focusing on the
    transition of
    training and deployment across U.S. and Swedish datasets. Initially, a model is trained with a clean U.S. training
    set,
    while an adversary simultaneously trains a compromised model using both clean and backdoored U.S. data, resulting in
    a
    model dubbed “U.S. BadNet.” Both the clean and compromised U.S. models undergo transfer learning with a clean
    Swedish
    training set, producing a benign “Swedish Baseline” and a potentially malicious “Swedish BadNet.” This process
    highlights how backdoors introduced in the training phase can propagate to different regional models, underscoring
    the
    critical importance of rigorous testing against both standard and manipulated inputs to ensure the deployed models’
    security and integrity in varied environments.</p></div>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <a href="Slide6.png"><img src="Slide6.png" alt="Image-5" class="image-frame"></a>
  <p>AiP is a memory forensic technique that recovers machine learning models from both main memory and GPU memory,
    allowing investigators to inspect the model's internal workings. This method has been evaluated across three
    versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch using datasets such as CIFAR-10, LISA (traffic sign dataset), and IMDB (movie
    review dataset). AiP successfully recovered 30 models with 100% accuracy, enabling detailed white-box testing to
    analyze the model's vulnerabilities. The approach supports both black-box and white-box testing environments,
    providing forensic investigators with the tools needed to perform a comprehensive analysis of deep learning systems.
  </p></div>

  <h2>Challenges in Model Recovery</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <a href="Slide9.png"><img src="Slide9.png" alt="Image-6" class="image-frame"></a>
  <p>There are several challenges in recovering machine learning models from memory. Many models are protected with
    encryption or are closed-source, making it difficult to retrieve them directly. Additionally, models that undergo
    online learning continuously update their weights, leading to unique, environment-specific models. AiP addresses
    these challenges by focusing on recovering models from memory images rather than requiring direct access to source
    code or encrypted binaries. The technique allows investigators to recover models in a way that preserves the
    integrity of the unique, real-time weights and structures found in production environments.</p></div>

  <h2>AiP Introduction</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <a href="Slide12.png"><img src="Slide12.png" alt="Image-7" class="image-frame"></a>
  <a href="Slide13.png"><img src="Slide13.png" alt="Image-8" class="image-frame"></a>
  <p>AiP enables the recovery of machine learning models, including those protected by encryption or undergoing
    real-time learning updates (online learning). Once recovered, these models can be rehosted for forensic analysis in
    a controlled environment. AiP operates by navigating both the CPU and GPU memory spaces to locate and extract key
    deep learning data structures, including tensors and model weights. This process allows investigators to analyze how
    the model was functioning at the time of failure or attack, providing valuable insights into the nature of the
    vulnerability.</p></div>

  <h2>Phase 1: Model Object Retrieval</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <a href="Slide15.png"><img src="Slide15.png" alt="Image-9" class="image-frame"></a>
  <a href="Slide19.png"><img src="Slide19.png" alt="Image-10" class="image-frame"></a>
  <p>The first phase of AiP involves searching for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in memory, which represent the
    structure of the deep learning model. DAGs are key to understanding how computations flow through the model. AiP
    identifies the root objects in memory, which point to other components of the model, such as layers and tensors.
    This process allows AiP to build a complete map of the model’s architecture, which is essential for further
    analysis. Once the model object is retrieved, it serves as the foundation for recovering all related tensors and
    computations.</p></div>

  <h2>Phase 2: Feedback-Driven Tensor Recovery</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <a href="Slide20.png"><img src="Slide20.png" alt="Image-11" class="image-frame"></a>
  <a href="Slide21.png"><img src="Slide21.png" alt="Image-12" class="image-frame"></a>
  <a href="Slide25.png"><img src="Slide25.png" alt="Image-13" class="image-frame"></a>
  <p>In this phase, AiP focuses on retrieving tensors—multi-dimensional arrays that store the data used in machine
    learning models—from memory. Tensors can be stored in both CPU and GPU memory, and AiP uses a feedback-driven
    approach to locate and recover them. The feedback mechanism ensures that only valid tensors are recovered, filtering
    out corrupted or irrelevant data. This step is critical for understanding the parameters that were used in the
    model's decision-making process. AiP also addresses the challenge of tensors being distributed across different
    memory spaces, ensuring that all relevant data is captured for forensic analysis.</p></div>

  <h2>Phase 3: Model Rehosting and Reuse</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <a href="Slide28.png"><img src="Slide28.png" alt="Image-14" class="image-frame"></a>
  <p>After retrieving tensors and other key components, AiP rehosts the model in a live environment for analysis. This
    step allows forensic investigators to perform white-box testing, where they have full access to the model's internal
    structure and behavior. The recovered tensors are transformed into an intermediate representation to ensure
    compatibility with the framework in use, enabling detailed analysis even if the model was initially secured by
    encryption or other security measures.</p></div>

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <div class="clearfix">
    <a href="Slide30.png"><img src="Slide30.png" alt="Image-15" class="image-frame"></a>
    <a href="Slide31.png"><img src="Slide31.png" alt="Image-16" class="image-frame"></a>
    <a href="Slide32.png"><img src="Slide32.png" alt="Image-17" class="image-frame"></a>
    <p>AiP was evaluated using several datasets, including CIFAR-10, LISA, and IMDB, across different versions of TensorFlow
      and PyTorch. In total, 30 models were recovered with 100% accuracy. This evaluation demonstrates AiP's capability to
      recover models in a variety of environments, handling complex memory management strategies and varying encryption
      levels effectively. The rehosting capabilities of AiP ensure that the recovered models perform identically to their
      original counterparts, showcasing the robustness of AiP in real-world forensic scenarios.</p></div>

      <h2>Simulation Setup</h2>
      <div class="clearfix">
      <a href="Slide33.png"><img src="Slide33.png" alt="Image-18" class="image-frame"></a>
      <p>A simulation compares two different forensic investigation methods: black-box analysis using AEVA (performed by Bob)
        and white-box analysis using AiP (performed by Alice). The simulation involves a self-driving car’s model being
        gradually poisoned with adversarial examples, introducing backdoors into the model. AiP is used to recover the model
        and detect these backdoors, highlighting its strength in identifying subtle backdoors that black-box methods may
        overlook.</p></div>

        <h2>Simulation Findings</h2>
        <div class="clearfix">
          <a href="Slide34.png"><img src="Slide34.png" alt="Image-19" class="image-frame"></a>
        <p>The simulation results indicate that Alice, using AiP and white-box analysis, successfully detected all backdoors
          embedded in the model with 100% accuracy. In contrast, Bob’s black-box approach failed to detect any backdoors. These
          findings underscore AiP's effectiveness in forensic investigations, particularly in scenarios involving sophisticated
          attacks like backdoor insertion.</p></div>

  <h2>Contributions of AiP</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <a href="Slide36.png"><img src="Slide36.png" alt="Image-20" class="image-frame"></a>
  <p>AiP offers a significant tool for forensic analysis, especially for models undergoing continuous updates. Its ability
    to recover and rehost models for white-box analysis surpasses traditional black-box methods, which often struggle to
    detect subtle vulnerabilities. By providing comprehensive access to the model's internal structure, AiP enables more
    thorough investigations into model behavior and vulnerabilities.</p></div>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <div class="clearfix">
    <a href="Slide37.png"><img src="Slide37.png" alt="Image-21" class="image-frame"></a>
    <p>While AiP is a powerful forensic tool, it has limitations. It may not perform effectively on models that have been
      heavily optimized or obfuscated, such as those using quantization techniques. Moreover, secure enclaves and trusted
      execution environments (TEEs) can inhibit memory acquisition, restricting AiP’s ability to recover models in certain
      cases. In highly protected environments, forensic investigators may need to employ additional techniques alongside AiP
      to achieve a complete analysis.</p></div>
<h2>Questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">Q1. Why is there a disparity in the ASR error rate? (Group 1)</h3>
<p class="answer">The disparity in the error rate typically arises in scenarios where a model behaves differently under
  certain conditions due to a specific trigger—an event or condition that causes a significant change in the model’s
  performance.</p>

<h3 class="question">Q2. To recover tensors instead of deterministic approaches, is it possible to use LLM's to recover
  the tensors? (Group 8)</h3>
<p class="answer">No, LLMs do not have enough context and also there are too many tensors, making it impractical to use
  LLMs for tensor recovery in this context.</p>

<h3 class="question">Q3. Are some models harder to recover? (Group 8)</h3>
<p class="answer">It totally depends on the ML framework. Some frameworks may have complex architectures or utilize
  advanced security features that make model recovery more challenging.</p>

<h3 class="question">Q4. Are they recreating the model from memory data? (Group 6)</h3>
<p class="answer">They are reconstructing the model, not recreating it from the memory data. Reconstruction involves
  piecing together model components from memory dumps to understand the model's architecture and functionality.</p>
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  
  <h3 class="question">Q1. How can ML/DL models be reconstructed and rehosted for different use cases, such as mobile,
    healthcare, or smart home devices?</h3>
  <p class="answer">Reconstructing ML/DL models for various use cases involves adapting them to different operational
    constraints and environmental factors. For instance, in a smart home scenario, an alarm system might trigger
    unexpectedly due to a hack. A snapshot of the memory at that time could allow a hacker to reconstruct the model and
    uncover vulnerabilities.</p>
  
  <h3 class="question">Q2. What are the anti-forensic methods available for model reconstruction frameworks, as discussed
    in this paper?</h3>
  <p class="answer">Anti-forensic methods that hinder model reconstruction include the use of ensemble networks and
    increasing model complexity. As the size of the model increases, it becomes more challenging to reconstruct it quickly
    and accurately, especially if the model uses techniques like ensemble learning, which can obscure the underlying data
    patterns and operational logic.</p>
  
  <h3 class="question">Q3. Could this framework be exploited by hackers to extract models that companies intend to keep
    secure from users?</h3>
  <p class="answer">Yes, while the framework is designed for forensic analysis and improving security, it also presents a
    potential risk if exploited by hackers. Hackers could potentially use similar techniques to extract and analyze
    proprietary models, especially if they gain access to memory dumps or can mimic the conditions under which the
    forensic analysis is typically performed.</p>
